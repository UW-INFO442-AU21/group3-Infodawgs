        <p>
          Infodawg's mission is to use data to make a difference in the challenges we face in the
          world today. Our focus in creating the food carbon emissions calculator is to give users 
          a readily accessible and quick way to determine the carbon impact of their eating habits.
          As food accounts for a third of the world's carbon emissions, choosing more sustainable
          options in our diet is a great first step to making a difference on our carbon footprint.
