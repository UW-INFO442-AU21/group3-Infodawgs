### ✨ Our Mission
Food production contributes to roughly 1/3 of the carbon emissions. For that reason, our group decided to create an application which allows users to learn about their own food carbon footprint, and take actions to reduce it through more sustainable food choices. 

### 🛠 Functionality
Our application includes references to educational resources and a carbon footprint calculator, which users can use to track the carbon emissions of their own consumption, and gain other basic information about what actions they can take.
